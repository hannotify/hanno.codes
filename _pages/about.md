Hanno Embregts is an IT Consultant at Info Support (the Netherlands). He has extensive experience with both front- and back-end development, with a special interest in automating the software development process to the fullest.

He likes his work best when it is fast-paced and versatile, which is why he juggles Java development, public speaking, leading Info Support’s Java Community and teaching courses at Info Support’s Knowledge Centre. When Hanno doesn’t have access to any kind of computer - which can only be called the most desperate of times - he plays in a band as a lead singer and guitar player. He is also a passionate fan of alternative rock band Switchfoot and Dutch football club Feyenoord. Last but not least: he has been told off repeatedly for using Star Wars quotes at work (things didn’t improve much by replying “I find your lack of faith disturbing”).
