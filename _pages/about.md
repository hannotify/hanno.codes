Hanno Embregts is {% include about/short-bio.md %}

In his day-to-day job as a Teacher / Technology Advocate at [Info Support](https://www.infosupport.com), Hanno prefers work that is fast-paced and versatile. This is why he juggles Java development, software architecture, public speaking, leading Info Support’s Speaker Community and teaching courses at Info Support’s Knowledge Centre. 

Hanno is both a [Java Champion](https://javachampions.org/members.html) and an [Oracle ACE Pro](https://ace.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/ace_program/oracle-aces/ace?ace_id=2413). He is also one of the editors of the Dutch [Java Magazine](https://nljug.org/category/java-magazine/). Outside of work Hanno likes making music with his friends. He plays the flute, the guitar and he likes to sing.

Software conferences are Hanno's favourite thing in the world, because they allow him to do the three things he loves most at the same time: learning new things, teaching others about stuff he discovered and yes: [even making music](/talks/#what-stairway-to-heaven-can-teach-us-about-software-development) from time to time!
