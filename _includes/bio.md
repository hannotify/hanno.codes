Hanno Embregts is a Java Developer, Speaker and Teacher at Info Support (the Netherlands). He has over 12 years experience with both front- and back-end development, with a special interest in automating the software development process to the fullest. He likes his work best when it is fast-paced and versatile, which is why he juggles Java development, public speaking and teaching courses at Info Support's Knowledge Centre. When Hanno doesn't have access to any kind of computer - which can only be called the most desperate of times - he plays in a band as a lead singer and guitar player. He is also a passionate fan of alternative rock band Switchfoot and Dutch football club Feyenoord. Last but not least: he has been told off repeatedly for using Star Wars quotes at work (things didn't improve much by replying "I find your lack of faith disturbing").
