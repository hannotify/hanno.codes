We've known lambdas and streams since Java 8, and they've made Java a more powerful language. In the next few versions of Java even more features that originated in functional languages will be added, one of which is 'pattern matching'. It provides an elegant way to apply conditions to certain aspects of an object. We investigated the possibilities that were introduced in JEP 305 ('Pattern Matching for instanceof') already and how the pattern matching roadmap will make Java an even more powerful language.
