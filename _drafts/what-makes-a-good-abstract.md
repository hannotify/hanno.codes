So you've got a great talk idea. Or perhaps you've even created an entire talk already, with nothing but awesome content. A program committee however doesn't know anything about your content; they only get to read a title and an abstract. So how do you make sure all that awesomeness is captured by an abstract that (in some cases) is restricted to, say, 1000 characters?

## Guidelines, Not Rules

## Ask Your Peers About It

## A Good Abstract...

### ...Catches the Attention

### ...Introduces the Subject Adequately

### ...Establishes the Speaker's Expertise

### ...Pinpoints the Target Audience

### ...Previews the Talk's Agenda

### ...Explains What the Audience Will Learn

### ...Calls to Action

### ...Is Concise
