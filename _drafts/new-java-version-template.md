## JEP Overview

## Repreviews and finalizations

Now it's time to take a look at a few features that might already be familiar to you, because they were introduced in a previous version of Java. They have been repreviewed (or finalized) in Java 25, with only minor changes compared to Java 24 in most cases. Therefore, to avoid a very lengthy article, we'll outline these changes and link to a previous article for a full feature description, should you wish to refresh your memory.
