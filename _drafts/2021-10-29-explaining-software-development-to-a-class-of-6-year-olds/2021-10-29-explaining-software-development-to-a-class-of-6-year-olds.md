My daughter is 6 years old, and in her class they are currently learning about various professions. Her teacher asked the parents whether they could come into the classroom and explain their profession in 15 minutes or so. I really liked the idea of inspiring these bright young minds with some fun stories about software development, so I applied and prepared a lesson. Which turned out to be a lot harder than I thought it would be.
