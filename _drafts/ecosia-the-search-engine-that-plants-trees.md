One of the reasons why I love creating software is because it can make the world a better place.
It can solve problems, make people more productive and automate the boring stuff.
And I strongly believe that it can contribute to climate action.
In fact, I feel we have a responsibility here, because in 2022 our industry as a whole already accounted for over 2 percent of global energy demand [1] (and it's rapidly rising [2]).
Since software developers are known for their ability to solve hard problems, let's start solving this one, too.
Which doesn't necessarily have to be hard.
Simply switching search engines can be a very good start.

## Search engine emissions

As you may already know, for each search query you perform some CO2 is emitted.
It's hard to get a precise number, but estimates range from 0.2 to 10 grams of CO2 per search query. [2]
That doesn't sound like much, but given the massive user base of the world wide web this quickly adds up, as the data visualization 'CO2GLE' demonstrates in a rather dramatic way. [3]
On top of that, an AI-assisted Google search uses 10 times more energy than a regular Google search. [4]
So in this day and age of AI, the potential to reduce is large and growing rapidly.

I'm not saying the mainstream search engines are bad, per se.
But they're not doing anything _special_ to reduce their emissions.
When it comes to sustainability in search engines, better options are available.

## Ecosia: the search engine that plants trees and runs on clean energy ðŸŒ±

Such as the Ecosia search engine! [5]
Like any search engine, Ecosia earns money through advertising.
But here's the big difference: Ecosia has pledged to spend 100% of their profits to climate action, through tree planting and supporting nature restoration projects. [6]

Since April 2017, Ecosia has produced twice as much renewable energy than what is needed to power their searches globally. 
Their solar plants feed clean energy back into the grid and help crowd out electricity derived from coal and other fossil fuels. 
Because they generate double the amount of renewable energy that they use, and they plant trees that lock up carbon, each search with Ecosia actually _removes_ 500 grams of CO2 from the air, making Ecosia a *carbon-negative* product. 

So just by simply using Ecosia for your daily searches, you can contribute to climate action!

## Search results

Which is great, but are the search results any good?
Ecosia's search results are delivered by both Bing and Google. [7]
In my experience 95% of what you're searching for can be found quickly.
For the remaining 5% it is easy enough to switch to a different search engine like Google by using the 'More' menu or to use the Google shortcut in your search query (`#g`).
More shortcuts exist; the full list is in Ecosia's help documentation. [8]

## Privacy

Ecosia takes user privacy seriously and is committed to protecting your data. 
They do not sell your information to third parties or track your searches. 
Ecosia anonymizes all searches within a week, ensuring your privacy is maintained.
This means that Ecosia is handling privacy a lot better than Google (though probably not as good as DuckDuckGo).

## Other features

Ecosia offers a few special features like currency conversion, translations, weather, and timezones conversions, which are presented to the user in widget form. [9] It also shows 'climate pledge ratings' (ranging from A to E) for search results, indicating companies' sustainability progress. Additionally, Ecosia has an 'AI Chat' feature (powered by OpenAI). It comes with a 'green mode', which means 1) answers will factor in sustainability and 2) your answers won't be used to train the AI model. [10]

## Money at Ecosia

Ecosia is transparent about its finances and tree-planting activities. The search engine posts monthly financial reports on its blog to disclose total monthly revenue and identify what percentage was used to plant trees. [11] For example, in May 2024, the search engine generated over â‚¬2.8 million, of which almost 26% was used to finance over 995,000 trees.

## Tree planting

Ecosia's tree planting is not about sticking random seeds in the ground and calling it a day.
They plant diverse forests (not sterile monocultures), preferring native and endangered species to imported and invasive ones. 
They plant in biodiversity hotspots that used to be forests, in over 30 countries. 
And they also monitor the trees with satellite tech and field visits for up to 20 years, while collaborating with local communities who make sure the trees will still be around to benefit their grandchildren.

According to Ecosia, it takes about 45 searches to fund the planting of a single new tree. 
This number could be reduced dramatically depending on other factors, like whether you click on an advert and how "valuable" the search term is in terms of advertisement payout.
So if you want Ecosia to make the most impact, then please consider disabling your ad blocker on ecosia.org, so that you may also discover (and navigate to) sponsored results.

## Conclusion

Switching to Ecosia is easy enough: browsers like Safari, Chrome and Brave already allow you to set Ecosia as the used search engine from the address bar. If that doesn't work in your browser, then Ecosia can be supported via an add-on. Simply visit ecosia.org in that browser and you'll be offered to download the right add-on.

And if you want to make even more sustainable impact, you could switch to the new Ecosia browser. [12]
For each day of using the browser, Ecosia pledges they will generate 25Wh of solar energy on your behalf.
Which means making the world a better place has become as easy as simply browsing the web 
 it doesn't get much easier than that!
