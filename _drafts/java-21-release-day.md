Today's the first day of Java 21's availability! It's been six months since Java 20 was released, and so it's time for another fresh wave of Java features. This post will take you on a tour through all JEPs that are associated with this release and give you a brief introduction to each one of them. Where applicable the differences with Java 20 are highlighted and a few typical use cases are provided, so that you'll be more than ready to use these features after you've finished reading!

## From Project Amber

Java 21 contains five features that originated from [Project Amber](https://openjdk.org/projects/amber/):

* String Templates;
* Record Patterns;
* Pattern Matching for switch;
* Unnamed Patterns and Variables;
* Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods.

> The goal of Project Amber is to explore and incubate smaller, productivity-oriented Java language features.
